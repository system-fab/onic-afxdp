# AMD OpenNIC Driver

This is one of the three components of the
[OpenNIC project](https://github.com/Xilinx/open-nic.git).  The other components are:
- [OpenNIC shell](https://github.com/Xilinx/open-nic-shell.git) and
- [OpenNIC DPDK](https://github.com/Xilinx/open-nic-dpdk.git).

OpenNIC driver implements a Linux kernel driver for OpenNIC shell.  It supports
multiple PCI-e PFs with multiple TX/RX queues in each PF, and up to two 100Gbps
ports on the same card.  As of version 1.0, the driver has not implemented the
ethtool routines to change the hash key and the indirection table.

The driver has been tested on under Ubuntu 18.04, 20.04, and 22.04 with multiple versions of the Linux kernel.

## Building the Driver

Follow the steps below to build the driver.

1. Run `make` to compile the loadable kernel module `onic.ko`.
2. Connect 100Gbps cables/loopback adapters to enabled ports before insert the
   kernel module.  Currently, the driver does not detect link status change.
   Thus links should be ready before loading the driver.
3. Run `sudo insmod onic.ko` to insert the kernel module. (There is an optional 
   parameter RS_FEC_ENABLED, which can be set to either zero or one.)
5. Verify that no error message is printed through `dmesg`, and new devices show
   up in `ifconfig` output.

The driver registers a net device for each PF it probed.  Net devices are
registered with multiple queues.  The number of queues depends on the number of
MSI-X vectors available through the associated PF.  In particular, for PF0 which
acts as the master PF, the number of queues equals to the number of MSI-X
vectors minus 2, one for card-level error interrupt and one for function-level
user interrupt; for other PFs, it equals to the number of MSI-X vectors minus 1.
Each net device has the same number of TX and RX queues.

For each FPGA card loaded with the OpenNIC shell bitstream, the driver detects
the number of CMAC instances and manages the links accordingly.  Only PF0 can
enable/disable the links.  The default bitstream, when configured with 2 PFs and
2 CMAC instances, maps PF0 to port0 and PF1 to port1.

## Testing the Driver

### Loopback Test

A loopback register is accessible from BAR2 at the offset `0x8090` and `0xC090`,
for port0 and port1 respectively.  One could use
[pcimem](https://github.com/billfarrow/pcimem) to read/write PCI device
registers.

To enable loopback, write `0x1` to the loopback register.  For instance, to
enable loopback on port0, issue the following command.

    sudo ./pcimem /sys/devices/pci0000:d7/0000:d7:00.0/0000:d8:00.0/resource2 0x8090 w 0x1

After that, packets received by CMAC0 will be looped back to the host.  Write
`0x0` to disable loopback.

Here is a simple scenario to test the loopback mode.  Assume the interface name
is `enp216s0f0` and the IP address is `192.168.1.10`.

1. Run `tcpdump` to capture packets on the interface.

        sudo tcpdump -i enp216s0f0 -xx

2. Run `ping 192.168.1.10`.
3. Observe that packets captured by `tcpdump` are always duplicated.

### ETHTOOL Test

`ethtool` is a Linux utility and used to control and read status of
various MAC parameters. Also, this tool is used to obtain various counter registers
(such as total good packets etc.) from the MAC.

  If the tool is not found, install it from distro.

  ```
  $ sudo apt install ethtool
  ```

  List all options that the tool can support

  ```
  $ ethtool -h
  ```

  List active interfaces, activate required interface
  Note: assume interface name is xyz01, IP address is 192.168.1.1

  ```
  $ ifconfig -a

  $ ifconfig xyz01 192.168.1.1 up
  ```

  Use ethtool interface to see the status
  Note: assume interface name is xyz01

  ```
  $ ethtool xyz01
  ```

  Show driver information
  Note: assume interface name is xyz01

  ```
  $ ethtool -i xyz01
  ```

  Show adapter statistics
  Note: assume interface name is xyz01

  ```
  $ ethtool -S xyz01
  ```

### LM-SENSORS Test

  To install lm-sensors framework:
  
     $ sudo apt install lm-sensors
  
     This installs 'sensors' application here: /usr/bin/sensors
  
  To enable lm-sensors framework support in open-nic
  
     a. In the file "onic_main.c", enable macro "CMS_SUPPORT"

     b. build the open-nic driver as explained above

  To test LM-SENSORS support in the open-nic
  
     Note: CMS IP in the design need to be added
     
     a, Load the kernel driver as explained above

     b. Run the sensors application, to see the data
        
        The output looks as below:

        $ sensors

         sn1000-onic-isa-0000

## Known Issues

### Static IP Address

It has been found that in some cases, DHCP clients may cause kernel panic after
inserting the kernel module.  A message similar as below show up in `dmesg`.

    [  224.835445] BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at ffff9d7f45effa1f

Assigning a static network address seems to solve the issue in most cases.  Add
the following lines into `/etc/network/interfaces` with the correct interface
name, IP address.

    ```
    auto IF_NAME
    iface IF_NAME inet static
          address IP_ADDRESS
    ```

An alternative is to uninstall DHCP.  This can be done by killing any running processes using DHCP with
`ps -eF | grep dhclient`, and then to disable DHCP.


### Machine locks up when installing kernel module

This seems to be related to the DHCP issue mentioned above in "Static IP Address".  The recommendation
is to disable DHCP.
